# Forecasters

This directory is meant to have implementations to make interface
with the trained load/gen forecaster

For now, it contains the following forecaster implementations:

- `hbgb_14.py` - Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting forecaster for the 14-bus network
- `hbgb_36.py` - Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting forecaster for the 36-bus network
